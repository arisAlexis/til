In postgresql the common convention is to have one database with a lot of schemas for example for each company site. This
is in contract with MySQL and other databases that favour multiple databases which are called "schema".

In latest versions, a database contains a company's database for example and tables are grouped in schemas. The default schema doesn't need to be prefixed so it's handy.
